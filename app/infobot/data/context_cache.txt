About KLS
More than three-quarters of a century ago, many eminent lawyers and visionaries from the North Karnataka region, who also happened to be leading lights in the Freedom Struggle, looked far ahead and decided that making legal education accessible to citizens of North Karnataka was a worthy goal, whatever the difficulty. Thus seven eminent lawyers ‚Äì N. S. Shrikhande, V.A. Naik, V. D. Belvi, B. N. Datar, S. N. Angadi. R. Kotbagi, D. S. Paramaj came together to form the Karnatak Law Society in 1939 in Belagavi. Shrimant Raja Lakhamgouda Sardesai of Vantmuri trusted these Founder Members to be true to their vision and a Promissory Note totaling Rs. 1 Lakh was executed by him to support the application for opening a new Law College. Many of these founder members, and other legal scholars from this region volunteered to teach at this College despite lucrative practice, and extensive personal and social commitments.
Belagavi thus became a renowned education centre for Law education. Students from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra took admission and proved to be active in social, political and judicial fields. The first batch of Raja Lakhamgouda College started operating in 1939, graduated in 1941. Since then, more than 7500 students have passed through the hallowed portals of this esteemed institution. A few notables among the many luminaries that this college has produced include ‚Äì Shri. E. S. Venkataramiah, Former Chief Justice of India, Shri. S. Rajendra Babu, Former Chief Justice of India & Chairman, National Human Rights Commission, .and Shri. K. K. Venugopal, Present Attorney General of India.
Today, Karnatak Law Society (KLS) has the distinction of running schools, and colleges in the fields of Law, Commerce, Engineering and Management Education and all its Institutions have earned reputation of being as leading institutions in Karnataka.

About Standards Club
:
Standards Club in association with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Government of India, Hubballi branch is inaugurated in KLS VDIT Haliyal by the chief guest Mr. Virendra Kadam, CEO and Founder, DELTSYS E-FORMING, Belagavi on 24/8/2023.
The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the National Standards body of India. It operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Government of India. BIS is responsible for the formulation, publication, and implementation of standards for various products, services, and systems to ensure their quality, safety, and reliability.
Here are some key points about BIS:
Quality consciousness, based on standardization, is one of the pillars of accelerated economic development, and priming students to appreciate the significance of quality, standards, and standardization can serve as a catalyst to improve societal awareness on these subjects.
BIS has taken the initiative of creating Standards Clubs in educational institutions comprising teachers and students as members. Through a variety of activities under these Clubs, young talents get learning opportunities in the field of quality and standardization.
Students are introduced to the concepts of Quality and Standardization with activities like Standards Writing, Quiz Competitions, Essay Writing, Poster Making, etc. in these clubs.
Standards Club members are also provided with an opportunity to visit industries and laboratories for practical understanding, complementing the theoretical study as part of the curriculum. This allows the students to appreciate the application of science concepts and understand their importance.
Benefits of BIS:
Consumer Protection:
BIS standards and certifications provide consumers with confidence that the products they purchase meet specific quality and safety standards.
Industrial Growth:
Standardization helps industries produce consistent and high-quality products, which can improve their competitiveness in domestic and international markets.
Safety:
BIS standards often focus on safety aspects, ensuring that products and services are designed and manufactured with safety in mind.
Trade Facilitation:
BIS standards align with international standards in many cases, facilitating trade and commerce by ensuring compatibility with global markets.
Quality Improvement:
BIS plays a role in promoting quality improvement across various sectors by setting benchmarks that companies strive to meet or exceed.
Environmental Impact:
BIS standards can also include guidelines for environmental sustainability, contributing to responsible and eco-friendly practices.

Department Virtual Tour
Civil Engineering is one of the oldest disciplines of engineering fields. Civil Engineering is all about infrastructural development and design techniques. The root of civilization is based on civil engineering. If there is no growth in the infrastructure of a country, one cannot think of growth in any sector. One of the greatest engineering legends from India, Sir. M. Vishweshwaryya who has been honored with the knighthood by the queen of England is basically a civil engineer.
Civil Engineers build the world‚Äôs infrastructure. In doing so they quietly shape the History of Nations around the world. To train the students with such qualities, the evergreen Civil engineering department was started for the academic year 2010-2011 with the intake of 60 in KLS‚Äôs VDIT Haliyal.
Department is well equipped with modern instruments to carry out the laboratory experiments.
The department has a library with a good number of books to help the students to upgrade their knowledge in various areas of Civil Engineering.
The department has a student‚Äôs association, ‚ÄúACES‚Äù which conduct Technical Talk, site visit Quiz, Building Model making to encourage the students and to showcase their talents.
Department is headed by Dr. Ashik Bellary along with other eight well-qualified teaching faculty.

Vibration & Thermography Monitoring
Vision
The Vision of Vibration and Thermography Consultancy at
KLS, Vishwanathrao Deshpande Institute of Technology, Haliyal
with
Diagnostic Engineers, Bangalore
is to make students Industry Ready, corporate training for Industries / Faculties and Consultancy for Industries in the area of Vibration and Thermography. The consultancy will be Mentored / Guided under the leadership of
Mr. Madhusudan N, Vibration Analyst, CAT‚ÄìII, ISO Certified, Diagnostic Engineers, Bangalore
.¬† ¬†He has got rich experience in the area of Condition Monitoring for more than 21 years covering various sectors like
Power sector, Steel Sector, Petroleum Oil / Refineries & Automotive Sector
. The KLS VDIT will be the
first college to start Proficiency Center
with Industry Connect in North Karnataka & North Kannada.
Why Vibration Monitoring and Thermography ?
Vibration monitoring is process of noticing a change in displacement/velocity/acceleration in rotating machine. Using FFT analyzer, the signals are collected in three different directions i.e. horizontal, vertical & axial directions. The centrifugal forces are increased at faulty location thus seen increase in amplitude at certain frequency. The overview of vibration monitoring is shown in figure 1,
Thermography is an excellent condition monitoring tool to assist in reduction of maintenance costs of the system. This technique allows for the monitoring of temperatures and thermal patterns while the equipment is online and running under full load. Most mechanical equipment has allowable operating temperature limits that can be used as guidelines. Infrared Thermal Imaging can be used on a wide variety of equipment including pumps, motors, bearings, pulleys, fans, drives, conveyors etc. Infrared Thermal Imaging enhances a company‚Äôs ability to predict equipment failure and plan corrective action before a costly shutdown or equipment damage.

Best Practices
Title 1: Value Added Service to Society
Objective
To create Awareness about Technology to the rural mass.
To Spread Nationalism, Human values and Life Ethics among Students and General Public.
The Context:
Higher Education Institutions not only contribute in providing technical skilled talent to the country, but also act as catalyst in enhancing life standards and life values among students, parents and public at large. The institutional responsibilities are not only limited to providing quality technical education to students there by helping them for better employment or to make them entrepreneurs but also to ensure they imbibe human values. At KLS VDIT, we are committed to provide quality technical education to students and to serve the society through various initiatives. Through our interaction with public, the need for creating awareness about technology was felt. To felicitate general public in understanding technology in better manner, technology connectivity programs are being conducted.
Practise:
All India Radio Program on ‚ÄúTechnology for Common Man‚Äù, was arranged. Every day one faculty used to explain about a technology in Kannada. A total of 60 episodes were aired. To check the understanding of listeners, a question was asked every day. Prizes were given for one correct answer every day. Another program on All India Radio by Motivational speaker, Shri Gururaj Karajagi received very good response. The program was sponsored by the institute and was aimed to inculcate life values and ethics.
Computer Literacy Program has been conducted for high school students, Government Class IV Employees as well as for and senior citizens. Entrepreneurial development program is being conducted for high school and junior college students. The program is aimed to develop entrepreneurship mind-set amongst youngsters. This program is conducted in association with Government of Karnataka. Awareness has been created in different areas of life in nearby villages under¬†Unnat Bharat Abhiyan like digital transactions, electoral literacy drive, electrical energy saving, etc.
A technical Exhibition Centre has been established in campus with the help of industries. Students from nearby schools and colleges are encouraged to visit the centre and understand different technologies. To create a sense of belongingness and brotherhood among students, institute regularly conducts blood donation camp, and other socially relevant programs.
Students, parents and staff actively participated in ‚ÄúHar Ghar Thiranga‚Äù¬†Abhiyan. National anthem is played at morning 9.30 am on all working days in the institution.
Evidence of Success
A sense of belongingness and discipline is observed among students. Huge response is received for All India Radio Program. Good feedback has been received from students and others.
Problems Encountered and Resources required
Initial reluctance from public to learn technologies
Title 2:¬† Student value addition and industry connect
Objective
To enhance technical and employability skills among students and better industry connect for faculty.
The Context:
Over a period of time, it is observed that the syllabus prescribed by the university alone is not sufficient to update technical skills of students. Few courses need to be introduced, apart from university curriculum, to acquire better technical skills/ employability. Current industry practices need to be updated among students and faculty.
The practice:
Different online courses are being floated among students in different semesters of their study. During the academic year 2021-22 more than 250 students completed TCSiON career edge young professional certification. More than 500 students completed IIT Bombay Spoken Tutorial courses on Python 3.4.3, C and Cpp, Advanced Cpp, HTML, QCAD,¬†Blender, Scilab, eSim, OpenFOAM. Students have registered and completed TATA Ready Engineer program. Apart from nearby industries, internship is offered through AICTE Internshaala Portal, Microchip, Redhat Academy, Blue Prism University, CELONIS. Institute sponsored Faculty¬† for training at BOSCH Bangalore. Five faculty, one from each department, are trained for a period of one week in the month of April 2022. Students from Mechanical Engineering Department were sponsored for training at HAL Academy, Bangalore for 2 weeks starting from¬† 05/09/2022. Faculty are trained in different domains through Eduskills, Coursera, NPTEL, IIT Bombay Spoken Tutorial. One faculty- one consultancy initiative is taken.
Evidence of Success
The increase in i) number of publications by faculty in reputed journals ii) number pf patents published iii) funding received¬† and¬† improvement in number of placements are testimony.
Problems Encountered and Resources required`
Convincing the students to take up additional courses apart from university syllabus.
